After a longer development time the new js-controller 4.0 (release name "Isabelle") has been released to the beta/test repository. Besides some optimizations and improvements, the main focus of this version was on performance improvements.

## JS Controller 4.x
This release omits Node.js 10.x, which has not been maintained since April last year. Node.js 16.x has been added. The supported Node.js versions are thus: 12.x, 14.x and 16.x. We are raising the recommended Node.js version for ioBroker to 14.x with this release. Node.js 16.x is now also supported with js-controller 4.0 using npm 7 or 8.

With js-controller 4.0 the database is internally changed from "file" to "jsonl". This happens automatically during the installation without any further actions if file is used. After the migration is done, the next time you open Admin 5, you will also see information about this. But what is so better about the JSONL database instead of file? The file DB writes here everything in a large JSON file regularly. This can definitely cause a lot of I/O and is not optimal especially for SD card based systems because it puts a lot of load on the card. But also for SSDs this is not optimal. Additionally there is the problem that a crash while writing leads to the whole file being corrupted. ioBroker falls back on a backup file in these cases. JSONL works differently. Changes are only appended to the file and - only if necessary - the file is "compressed" and rewritten. A broken byte in the DB does not break everything and a crash during the write process only makes sure that the pending changes are lost, not everything. JSONL also conserves the SD card by doing fewer and smaller writes.

The new version is expected to be available in the stable branch by the end of the month. More information on changes in JS Controller 4 can be found [here]((https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.js-controller/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)).

## Ack/Confirmed
One topic that keeps coming up is the Ack flag. It starts with the Blockly with the "control" and "update", goes over the colors (red, green, yellow) of the values in the admin and ends with the developers, who have to use this flag correctly. In principle, it is quite simple: the Ack or Confirmed flag says that this value is safe. Let's say you turn on a lamp via ioBroker. For this one sets the value of the datapoint to true. This value is now not confirmed and appears red in the admin. This means that ioBroker has sent a command to the lamp, but has not received a response yet. So the ack flag is set to "false". Then as soon as the lamp has sent the response to the server, the value in the admin turns green. Then the flag jumps to "true" and you can be sure that the value also reflects the actual state of the lamp. The yellow state in the admin is simply the default value of a datapoint. This means that this datapoint has never had a value and therefore takes the default value.

With the blockly we send with the "control" block practically the command to the device. (Ack false) With "update" a datapoint is simply set to a confirmed value. This is done if, for example, the datapoint was created by us and we know for sure that the value reflects the current state.

Developers should also make sure that they use the flag at the right time. [Here you can find more information about this](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.docs/blob/master/docs/en/dev/adapterdev.md#commands-and-statuses).

## Device Management
At the meeting, there was a lot of talk about the new Device Manager. In the long term, this should take over the setting of the devices at individual adapters, so that you only have a uniform interface to set, include and exclude devices. We are still evaluating, but as soon as a few adapters have been changed over and the manager is on beta, we will report on it.

## New adapters
Also this month we can shine with some new additions.

The temperatures and the wind are still cold! At home, you can now make yourself comfortable and let the [thermostats from Netatmo]((https://github.com/Homemade-Disaster/ioBroker.netatmo-energy)), as well as the [saunas from Huum](https://github.com/Chris-1965/ioBroker.huum-sauna) controlled via ioBroker. In the smart home system area, we are happy to say that we now support devices from [Gigaset](https://github.com/matthsc/ioBroker.gigaset-elements), [Blebox](https://github.com/ka-vaNu/ioBroker.blebox) and [Panasonic Cloud](https://github.com/marc2016/ioBroker.panasonic-comfort-cloud). In the alarm area, [Hikvision cameras](https://github.com/raintonr/ioBroker.hikvision-alarmserver) can now be integrated, and in the energy area, the [E3DC home power plant](https://github.com/git-kick/ioBroker.e3dc-rscp) and [Resol VBus](https://github.com/Grizzelbee/ioBroker.resol) devices.

Furthermore, an adapter for [Webuntis](https://github.com/Newan/ioBroker.webuntis) was released. With it the timetables as well as class work of connected schools can be pursued.

With the [Alexa-Timer-Vis](https://github.com/MiRo1310/ioBroker.alexa-timer-vis) adapter it is easier to use the timers from [Alexa2](https://github.com/Apollon77/ioBroker.alexa2) and with the [Signal Messenger](https://github.com/necotec/ioBroker.signal-cmb) adapter we now have all major messengers on board.

But it's not just new adapters that have appeared. Also the new [Material App for Android devices](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iobrokermaterial) was released. With it, you can access the visualization of the Material Adapter on the go. [Material](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.material) was designed to automatically create ads without the user having to invest a lot of time in the setup.

## Translations
ioBroker now supports 10 languages and these are automatically translated in the first step. We all know these automatic translations and we know that they are more than poor. Since we are always looking to perfect our project, we have now transferred 81 of the existing adapters into the [Weblate project](https://weblate.iobroker.net/accounts/login). Here everyone can help to improve the translations. It is also very simple and can be done from your cell phone.

We would like to ask the community to help us, because every translated word is a step forward for all of us. To the adapter developers among us we would like to ask you to [integrate your adapter into the weblate](https://github.com/ioBrokerTranslator/doc/blob/master/README.md), if your adapter has a lot of text to translate.

## Closing words
This time there were a lot of people at the meeting and we think that's great, because ioBroker can only exist and go on with and through you. Right at the beginning of the meeting we remembered the times before Corona and our live meetings that took place annually in Kassel. We hope that these times will come back soon and we can meet again in Kassel/Germany (or wherever).

The next meeting will take place on March 16th. Have fun in the ioBroker world. Stay healthy!
